Aim of Learning Python;
    -> God-AI
    -> AI based work which includes Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science 

    
    
Some Basics;
    -> Programming Language; A language to communicate with machines

    -> Human  ->  Programming Language   ->  Interpreter / Compiler  ->  Machine Language [Binary(0, 1)]  ->  Machine Work

    -> Programming Languages; Python, C / C++, JS, etc.

    -> Python  ->  Interpreter  ->  cpython  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    -> That's why Python is not fast as C
    -> Python is much closer to english

    -> C / C++  ->  Compiler  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    -> That's why C is fast 
    -> C is not much closer to english so, it is much closer to machines

    -> Interpreter; Reads code line by line

    -> Compiler; Reads whole file at a time
